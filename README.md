# Weather-Application
### Project Summary:
Designed a weather application, that essentially prompts a user to enter the name of a city into a text input. The input from the user is then used to structure a URL that is then used to fetch data from an external server. The JSON format data, obtained as a response from the external server, is then parsed into a JavaScript Object, making it relatively easy to target specific pieces of data that are then rendered onto a website as live API data.
### External node modules used:
- express
- body-parser
### Languages and technologies:
- HTML5 
- JavaScript ES6
- Unix Command Line
- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenWeatherMap API
