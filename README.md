# Weather-Application
### Project Summary:
Created a weather application that prompts users to enter a city name into a text input. The user input is used to create a URL that is then utilized to fetch data from an external server. The JSON-formatted data, obtained as a response from the external server, is then parsed into a JavaScript Object, making it relatively easy to target specific pieces of data that are then displayed on the website as live API data.
### External node modules used:
- express
- body-parser
### Languages and technologies:
- HTML5 
- JavaScript ES6
- Unix Command Line
- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenWeatherMap API
### Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in building web applications that utilize external APIs. It showcases my understanding of routing, server-side processing of data and the use of external modules such as “express” and “body-parser”. The project prompts users to enter a city name into a text input, which is then used to create a URL that is utilized to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The JSON-formatted data obtained as a response is then parsed into a JavaScript Object, making it relatively easy to target specific pieces of data that are then displayed on the website as live API data. This project also showcases my proficiency in HTML5, JavaScript ES6 and my understanding of how to interact with the command line interface to execute the application and view the results.
